# Happy Thoughts

This React app uses state to manage the list of thoughts and the number of likes. To complete the project, I built an API in the backend and made API calls in the frontend to fetch and post data to a server. 

## The problem

I used React to build the app and managed state and data fetching using useState and useEffect hooks. When needed, I used ChatGPT and Technigo's StackOverflow to get help. I planned by almost completing an example project provided by Technigo, and used that code as a starting point for the final project by modifying what didn't work.
